Conclusions drawn:
 1) Audio and World Music categories had a 100% success rate. There's a large audience who's into auditory entertainment.
 2) There is a lot of people who are creating and funding plays. Theatre is still very much alive.
 3) Technology projects seem to have a greater chance of achieving their funding goals than other categories.

Limitation:
 1) Majority of the data is from the U.S. so data usefulness is mostly limited to U.S. and doesn't do a good job displaying the audience opinion at a global level. 


Other possible tables/graphs:
 We could include age groups to get a better analysis of which or if one age group supports a certain type of project more than another project or another age group.
